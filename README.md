###  Project Overview
This project involves building a robust data pipeline that integrates Snowflake and dbt (data build tool) with Apache Airflow for end-to-end data automation. The pipeline is designed to streamline the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) by leveraging Snowflake's powerful cloud data warehousing capabilities and dbt's transformation logic.
Airflow orchestrates the workflow to ensure automation and scalability, enabling seamless scheduling, monitoring, and management of data pipelines. This solution provides a reliable, efficient, and automated framework for managing large-scale data processes, empowering data-driven decision-making.
### Problem statement  
Organizations today face several challenges when it comes to managing and processing data efficiently and some of this challenges include:
- Manual Data Processes: Traditional methods of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data often involve manual intervention, which makes the process time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
- Scalability Issues: As data volumes increase, existing systems struggle to handle large-scale data transformations and processing efficiently.
- Fragmented Workflows: The use of multiple, disconnected tools for data warehousing, transformation, and orchestration leads to disjointed workflows, resulting in a lack of visibility and increased complexity.
- Delayed Insights: Without automation, delays in data processing result in outdated insights, hindering timely and data-driven decision-making.
- Complex Pipeline Management: Managing dependencies, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines across multiple systems becomes increasingly complex as workflows expand.

To address these challenges, the project proposes a solution that integrates Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow to create an automated data pipeline.
this will Automate the ETL process, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.
Leverage the scalability of Snowflake’s cloud infrastructure to handle large data volumes.
Integrate and streamline workflows across different systems, ensuring seamless data processing and improved visibility.

####  How to Set Up the Tech Stack
- Set Up Snowflake as Your Data Warehouse
To begin, we will use Snowflake as the data warehouse for storing and analyzing large datasets. Follow these steps to create an account and set up the necessary structures within Snowflake:
Go to the Snowflake website: [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/platform/)  Sign up for a Snowflake account by filling in the required details. After signing up, you will be directed to the Snowflake console

- Setting Up dbt for Snowflake Integration
To set up dbt with Snowflake, follow the steps below. This guide includes downloading and installing dbt, configuring it for Snowflake, and creating the necessary files for connection

#### Data Sources Overview
This project leverages several data sources that provide critical information for the analysis and transformation processes. The primary data sources are CSV files that are loaded into the staging area of the snowflake. Here’s an overview of the data sources used:
-  Customer Data
-  product Data
-  orders Data
-  sales Data
-  store data
- Type of Data: Structured
- Source: CSV file
- Format: CSV

`python --version
`
#### Data Flow Overview
the data flow describes how raw data moves from its source into the Snowflake data warehouse and is processed through various stages to become ready for analysis. Here's a high-level breakdown of the data flow.
- Data Ingestion (Raw Data Loading): The data originates from CSV files (Customer, Orders, Product Sales, Store) that are loaded into Snowflake as the raw input file
- Data is ingested into Snowflake via staging tables.
- The raw data is initially stored in Snowflake's stage and a copy command is used to load the data into the raws schema.
- pipe are create that also help in loading the data  for automation.
