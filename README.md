###  Project Overview
This project involves building a robust data pipeline that integrates Snowflake and dbt (data build tool) with Apache Airflow for end-to-end data automation. The pipeline is designed to streamline the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) by leveraging Snowflake's powerful cloud data warehousing capabilities and dbt's transformation logic.
Airflow orchestrates the workflow to ensure automation and scalability, enabling seamless scheduling, monitoring, and management of data pipelines. This solution provides a reliable, efficient, and automated framework for managing large-scale data processes, empowering data-driven decision-making.
### Problem statement  
Organizations today face several challenges when it comes to managing and processing data efficiently and some of this challenges include:
- Manual Data Processes: Traditional methods of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data often involve manual intervention, which makes the process time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
- Scalability Issues: As data volumes increase, existing systems struggle to handle large-scale data transformations and processing efficiently.
- Fragmented Workflows: The use of multiple, disconnected tools for data warehousing, transformation, and orchestration leads to disjointed workflows, resulting in a lack of visibility and increased complexity.
- Delayed Insights: Without automation, delays in data processing result in outdated insights, hindering timely and data-driven decision-making.
- Complex Pipeline Management: Managing dependencies, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines across multiple systems becomes increasingly complex as workflows expand.

To address these challenges, the project proposes a solution that integrates Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow to create an automated data pipeline.
this will Automate the ETL process, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.
